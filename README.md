## KNOWN BUGS:

- It is included effects features, like hue, brightness, blur, and more, but they're disabled since they consume a lot of memory.
- Sometimes, going back to clickable mode after rotating in 3d mode, the trackbars don't use the original coordinates.

If you find this tool useful, and want me to continue its support, I'd appreciate your support.
